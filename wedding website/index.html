                        You might see us walking around or just sitting by each other smiling and laughing with one another and think to yourself "that couple is madly in love!" This is very true! However, it did not start out that way at all.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Syllissa and Vonterio attended the same high school, Middleton, for all 4 years and they knew of each other the whole time because they rode the same bus to school. It was not until the summer before senior year when they both became a part of the same small friend group. After doing many events together with friends, Vonterio started to be attracted to Syllissa. Actually Vonterio wanted to date Syllissa even prior to this two years ago, but at the time she was already in a relationship so this was not an option. Our friends within our group knew that Vonterio liked Syllissa, and always posed the "hypothetical" question to Syllissa of whether or not she would date Vonterio.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p> 
                        The answer would always be the same: "I don't see him in that way", " I only like him as a friend", "He is more like a <b>BROTHER</b> to me". That last quote is the one that killed Vonterio's soul on the inside, and to this day is always brought up as a funny talking point in our relationship. Luckily, these words did not stop Vonterio from trying.

                    <p>
                        Fast forward to February 13, 2016, when the idea of love is very much in the air, Vonterio makes a cute and well thought sign representing Drake's (Syllissa's favorite artist) album cover art asking her to prom. Prom was not until April, but Vonterio did not want to waste any time, and Syllissa said YES! If you want to watch it go down see it here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMlJzorpLU0&t=55s" target="_blank">Promposal Video</a>

                    <p>
                        About two weeks later after constant texting and phone calls throughout the late night, Vonterio asked Syllissa out on a date for February 27th, 2016 to movies and ice cream. Near the end of the date, Vonterio asked Syllissa to be his girlfriend and... she said no! She thought it was some funny joke, but then he asked again and this time she said yes :)
                    </p> 
                    
                    <p>
                        We both graduated from Middleton a few months later, and the best/funny part of our graduation was that we were both Top 10 in our class. Syllissa was 9th and Vonterio was 10th in the class. Which is something Syllissa forever holds over Vonterio's head. Vonterio decided to go to USF to major in Computer Science, while Syllissa went to UF to major in Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience. This distance definitely was hard to cope with the entire time, but their love for each other was too strong to let that ruin their relationship. They would always call and text throughout the day, video chat at night, and then call each other over the phone at bedtime to simulate sleeping together. Before Vonterio had his own vehicle, about once or twice a month he would take the RedCoach charter bus to Gainesville to visit Syllissa for a couple days. He would then drive up there on his own when he did get his own car.

                    <p>
                        Fast forward again to May 28th, 2019, which is more than 3 years into their relationship and also happens to be Syllissa's birthday. The week prior to this, Syllissa and her family went on a little vacation back to their home state of Oklahoma to visit family members and friends. Vonterio decided to use that time as the perfect chance to find Syllissa a wedding ring! He had already talked to both his mom and dad about marrying Syllissa and they were shocked by how grown up their son was becoming, but were super excited and happy for him. The ring he picked, was the 3rd ring he looked at, but he continued to look at others just in case, but he knew this ring was definitely the one. From there he knew he had to come up with a plan to actually propose! We won't go into anymore details about the proposal here, but there is a full video you can watch here instead! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRbKeVxr1Pc&t=12s">Engagement Video</a>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Even if you did not watch the video, you can probably guess that again Syllissa said YES! Vonterio is now 3 for 4 on these important questions! But now as this "Love Story" is being written, they have been together now for four years and it has almost been a whole year since our engagement. Less than a year from now on February 27th, 2021, exactly 5 years from when our relationship started, we will be standing at the altar saying "I do". Starting a new chapter in our love story.
